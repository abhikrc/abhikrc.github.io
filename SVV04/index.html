<br>
</b>Software is playing an important role in economy, government, and military. 
Since software is often deployed in safety critical applications, correctness 
and reliability have become issues of utmost importance. Techniques for 
verification and validation traditionally fall into three main categories. The 
first category involves informal methods such as software testing and 
monitoring. The second involves formal verification, i.e., model checking and 
theorem proving. The third is abstract interpretation and static program 
analysis techniques.</p>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to promote discussion on novel combinations of 
these methodologies, as well as study the individual contribution of each of 
these methodologies in verifying software. An example of a combined 
verification methodology is the recent research direction that combines 
abstraction (of 
infinite-state programs into finite-state ones) with model checking (of 
finite-state systems).&nbsp; There is a growing conviction in the research 
community that such hybrid methodologies are imperative for the process of&nbsp; 
analyzing full-fledged software systems. This workshop will study 
combination of analysis methodologies for verification of software.&nbsp; This 
research is very important and timely since </p>
<ul>
  <li>Software is being increasingly used to control embedded systems which are 
  often safety critical (such as automobile parts).</li>
  <li>&nbsp;There is renewed promise in program verification in the recent years 
  due to (a) progress in generating models from code, and (b)&nbsp; combination 
  of model checking with other analysis techniques such as abstract 
  interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="topics"></a>Topics Covered</b></p>
<p>The workshop will focus on theoretical techniques, practical methods as well 
as case studies for verification of&nbsp; conventional and embedded software 
systems. In particular, we welcome papers which describe combinations of formal 
and informal reasoning, as well as formal verification and program analysis 
techniques. Tool papers and case studies, which report on&nbsp; advances in 
verifying large scale programs in standard languages 
are particularly sought. The list of topics include, but are not restricted 
to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tools, environments and case studies for large scale software verification</li>
  <li>Static analysis/Abstract interpretation/Program transformations for 
  verification </li>
  <li>Use of model checking and deductive techniques for software verification</li>
  <li>Role of declarative programming languages (such as Prolog) for infinite 
  state software verification. </li>
  <li>Techniques to validate system software (such as compilers) as well
   as assembly code/Java bytecode </li>
  <li>Proof techniques for verifying specific classes of software (such as 
  object-oriented programs) </li>
  <li>Integrating testing and run-time monitoring with formal techniques</li>
  <li>Validation of UML diagrams, and/or&nbsp; requirement 
  specifications</li>
  <li>Software certification and proof carrying code</li>
  <li>Integration of formal verification into software development projects</li>
</ul>

<b><i> Title</i>:  Context-bounded model checking of concurrent software</b><br>
<b><i> Abstract</i></b>:
<i>Designing concurrent programs is difficult.  The nondeterministic
interaction between concurrently executing threads of a concurrent
program results in programming errors that are notoriously difficult to
reproduce and fix.  Automated program analysis techniques for finding
such errors are invaluable as a debugging and programming aid.  In this
talk, I will present a novel static analysis technique for concurrent
software based on the idea of context-bounded model checking.

An execution of a concurrent program is a sequence of contexts, where
each context is an uninterrupted sequence of transitions performed by a
single thread.  Our work is motivated by our observation that many
subtle errors in a concurrent program are manifested by executions with
few contexts.  I will first present KISS (Keep It Simple and
Sequential), a technique for transforming a concurrent program P into a
sequential program Q that encodes all executions of P with a small
number of contexts.  We used KISS to convert SDV (Static Driver
Verifier), a model checker for sequential C programs, into a model
checker for concurrent C programs.  The combination of KISS and SDV has
found a variety of subtle concurrency errors in Windows device drivers.

Next, I will present a new theoretical result which shows that bounding
the number of contexts significantly reduces the complexity of verifying
concurrent programs.  It is well-known that the problem of verifying
assertions in a concurrent boolean program is undecidable.  I will show
that if analysis is limited to executions with a fixed but arbitrary
context-bound, the problem becomes decidable, even in the presence of
unbounded dynamic thread creation.</i>

<b><i> Title:</i> A Game approach to Software Testing</b><br>
<b><i> Abstract</i></b> : 
<i>We give a brief overview of the model-based testing tool SpecExplorer
developed at Microsoft Research and the modeling language Spec# used by
SpecExplorer. The tool supports nondeterminism and provides a view of
testing a nondeterministic system as a two player game.
Generated tests are considered as game strategies.
The underlying conformance relation is given by alternating refinement
of interface automata.</i>
