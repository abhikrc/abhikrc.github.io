<p><i><b>Invited&nbsp; Talk</b></i></p><p><b>A Game approach to Software Testing</b><br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Margus Veanes (Microsoft Research, USA)</b></p><p><i>We give a brief overview of the model-based testing tool SpecExplorer developed at Microsoft Research and the modeling language Spec# used by SpecExplorer. The tool supports nondeterminism and provides a view of testing a nondeterministic system as a two player game. Generated tests are considered as game strategies. The underlying conformance relation is given by alternating refinement of interface automata.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/SVV04/program.html">Back to technical programme page</a></b></p>
