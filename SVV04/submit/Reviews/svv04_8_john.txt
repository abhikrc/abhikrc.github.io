3 - Main Contributions of the paper

For a specialized class of real-time scheduling problems, the paper
determines a scheduling regime that satisfies certain constraints.  The
key idea is that a schedule can be found knowing only that the execution
time of each job lies within certain bounds and that there are certain
constraints on job sequencing. 

4 - Points in favour or against the paper

The paper is not particularly focused on verification, although the
technique could be used to verify the existence of a scheduling regime
for this specialized scheduling problem.  

5 - Specific comments for improving the paper

The paper references a Figure (in section 5.1) that is not included in
the paper.  Similarly, there is an unidentified reference in the Summary
section (section 7).
