   Z: I am not an expert. My evaluation is that of an informed outsider.



 3 - Main Contributions of the paper
This paper defined a type system for SSA representations generated by gnu compilers,
and use that to show correctness of optimizing steps taken by compilers. The proof obligation is
reduced to type checking. 

 4 - Points in favour or against the paper
It is a great idea to exploit the SSA representation and formulate the type system that can be used to establish correctness of optimizing compilers.

 5- Specific Comments for improving the paper
Explioting SSA for verification purpose (not compiler verification but refinement verification in the context of refinement based hardware design) is not new. See papers by Jean-Pierre Talpin et al in ACSD 2003 and ACSD 2004, and CASES 2004.
