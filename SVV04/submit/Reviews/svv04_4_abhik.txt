 3 - Main Contributions of the paper

This paper deals with the problem of verifying object systems, without
generating and traversing the global state space. For this reason, the
effort is to investigate how a condition which involves lookup of the 
state of several objects can be done efficiently without constructing
the global state space. The paper specifically focuses on objects
communicating asynchronously.


 4 - Points in favour or against the paper

The paper is too sketchy in the first place. The description of the 
multi-object logics (section 3) is so sketchy that is almost impossible
to follow. I liked the overall idea of employing observers mentioned
in section 4. However, here again the idea is not developed (even for
the standards of a workshop paper) and the author simply mentions that
in certain situations observer objects may not exist.
