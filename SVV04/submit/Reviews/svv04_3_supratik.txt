3 Main Contributions of the Paper:
The paper presents a compositional framework for modeling and verifying
mobile network protocols. A mobile network protocol is represented as a
set of communicating sequential tasks. Each task is modeled as a symmbolic
transition graph with assignment. It is shown that persistently resettable
protocols are deadlock free if all the component tasks. Mobile IP is used
as a case study

4 Points in Favor or Against:
The paper seems to have been written in a rush with many notions kept
undefined. For example while defining STGA's no syntax for Exp or bExp is
provided. On page 3, the authors suddenlty start using process calculus
notation without introducing it. Which model checker was used in Section
4? Besides all you show is checking for deadlock. What about properties
like mutual exclusion? What was the use of using a mu calculus formula for
specifying deadlock freedom without introducing mu calculus?

5. Comments for Improvement:
The paper has a lot of typos. For example space should be introduced in
"outside(true)..." on page 6. Before stating a notion formally, you should
first describe it in English and then use a formal description.
