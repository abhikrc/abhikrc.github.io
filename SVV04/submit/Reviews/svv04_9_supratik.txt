Review for Chatha's paper:
 The fundamental contribution is weak. They apply
 model-checking to a problem that can be attacked
 without model-checking as well. Nowhere in the paper
 is it said what the relative benefits are. Race conditions
 are to be identified and resolved, but what is wrong
 with static analysis? The problem I have with dynamic
 analysis is that the race condition may be detected too
 late, i.e., the process has already started. In case
 of hard real-time systems, this is compleltely unacceptable.

 Consider the following mechanism: Use relative timing
 constraints to impose order; that way the race problem
 can be completely eliminated; however, the freedom of
 non-determinism is lost.

 But they have made some contributions and for a workshop,
 this paper SHOULD be accepted;
