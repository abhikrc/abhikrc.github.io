 3 - Main Contributions of the paper
This paper formalizes the UML class and  activity diagrams' semantics based on 2001 thesis of Richter,
and  then applies OCL constraints to express required properties of a business process. The verification is done using OCL interpretation and the authors are studying model checking tools.
They make their tool based on meta information such that ill formed diagrams are ruled out.

 4 - Points in favour or against the paper
I like the idea of making the diagrammatic modeling of business processes amenable to formal analysis.
Also the idea of making highlightings on the UML diagram when an OCL constraint is violiated is a good debugging aid for users who are usually not formally inclined, and are business process developers.

 5- Specific Comments for improving the paper
Please check the projects on using meta modeling based on UML called GME (Vanderbilt Univ) and META-X at Virginia Tech (http://fermat.ece.vt.edu/METAX.htm)
