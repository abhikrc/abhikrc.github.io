3 Main Contributions of the Paper:

The paper presents a new algorithm for detecting negative cycles in a
graph that requires zero extra space. The correctness of the algorithm is
proved

4 Points for or against:
It has generally been argued that space complexity is more important in
verification than time complexity. The paper addresses the space
complexity of a particular problem, the negative cycle detection problem
in a directed graph. The problem has been found to be important in
constraint based (program) analysis. While existing algorithms require
linear space, the proposed algorithm does not require any book keeping.

The paper is well written

5 Comments for improving the paper:
The author states that it is not known whether a modified version of the
algorithm can be used to solve the single source shortest path problem.
This needs to be investigated since it can lead to better algorithms for
finding the shortest counterexample in model checking
