 3 - Main Contributions of the paper

The authors specify and analyse network protocols using Symbolic Transition 
Graphs a formalism introduced by Lin in 1996.
While it is not surprising that STGAs can be used for such a task (Lin used them
to reason on value passing calculi), a new sufficient condition for deadlock 
freedom seems the main contribution of the paper.
The condition is formulated in a compositional way (under special conditions 
if the components are deadlock free then the network protocol 
is deadlock free).
This condition is applied to some example of mobile IP protocols.
Lin's model checker is used in the experiments.
For lack of time, I have not checked the correctness of the statements.

 4 - Points in favour or against the paper

The use of STGA for modelling protocol is not novel.
However, the new sufficient condition for deadlock freedom seems
of some interest at least in the examples discussed in the paper.

 5- Specific Comments for improving the paper

Other formalisms and tools have been used to specify and analyse 
network protocols.
