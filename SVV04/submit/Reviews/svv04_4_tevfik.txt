paper?

   Y: I am knowledgeable in the area, though not an expert

 3 - Main Contributions of the paper

It is not possible to assess the contributions of this paper since the
technical model is not explained.

 4 - Points in favour or against the paper

Points in favor:
Model checking object systems which communicate with asynchronous 
messages is an important problem.

Points against:
The paper does not give any background and technical definitions of the
concepts that are mentioned.

 5- Specific Comments for improving the paper

This paper is not acceptable in its current form.  The author should 
include an explanation of the logics D_0 and D_1. In order to make sense 
of this paper one has to first read all the earlier papers written by the 
authors. Since there is no shortage of space as far as this paper is 
concerned (it is only five pages) there is no need to omit technical 
definitions. The author should formally define the syntax and the 
semantics of the multi-object logics mentioned in this paper. However 
I do not think this can be fixed for this workshop so I would recommend 
rejecting this paper.

There are also errors in the use of English, editing is needed.
