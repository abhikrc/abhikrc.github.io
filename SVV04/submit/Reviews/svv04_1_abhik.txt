 3 - Main Contributions of the paper

This paper reports consistency check of static diagrams (such as class
diagrams) and dynamic diagrams (such as collaboration diagrams) in BON.
The consistency check is supported by symbolic execution since the 
messages in the collaboration diagram roughly correspond to method
invocations which are mentioned with pre/post conditions in the class
diagrams.

 4 - Points in favour or against the paper

The basic idea of the paper is a simple one, but clearly presented
in full details. Details about how the consistency check is performed
at each step of the symbolic execution is also presented, and the use 
of the Simplify theorem prover in this matter is a reasonable choice.

 5- Specific Comments for improving the paper

The author should consider dynamic diagrams representing a labelled 
partial order for example a Message Sequence Chart. This can again
come in various flavors : synchronous/asynchronous message passing.
Even more interesting is to study dynamic diagrams which are executable
and constitute a complete spec. at some level of abstraction (i.e. do
not just denote a single scenario). The authors might want to look up
the work of Damm and Harel on Live Sequence Charts. Symbolic execution
of such diagrams (simulation though) have been studied in the 
paper "Symbolic Execution of Behavioral requirements" in PADL 2004.
