       Structure Consistency

Authors: Karen Zee, Patrick Lam, Viktor Kuncak, and Martin Rinard

1 - How do you classify this paper?

   3: Strong Accept

 2 - What is your overall expertise concerning the subject areas of this
paper?

   X: I am an expert.

 3 - Main Contributions of the paper

The main contribution of the paper is to present an approach which combines 
different verification techniques in one framework. In particular the 
authors use theorem proving, shape analysis and a technique for analyzing 
typestates of the object. These techniques are integrated to a 
specification and verification environment as plugins.

 4 - Points in favour or against the paper

I think this paper is an excellent paper for this workshop. It presents
an approach that combines the strengths of different techniques to verify 
properties of some interesting software modules.

 5- Specific Comments for improving the paper

Since the paper covers a lot (a specification language, three verification 
techniques), technical details are omitted at some parts.

Theorem proving techniques have not been very successful in software 
verification since they require too much user interaction. Some discussion 
about why the authors think that this trend will change would be useful.
