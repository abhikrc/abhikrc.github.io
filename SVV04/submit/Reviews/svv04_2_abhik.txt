 3 - Main Contributions of the paper

This paper studies the verification of structural properties of UML
diagrams. The properties are expressed in OCL and model checking 
is employed. The applition domain is for business processes.


 4 - Points in favour or against the paper

One interesting point of the paper is the properties are expressed 
on the UML meta-models. This is because the authors concentrate on
general reachability properties (such as all nodes are reachable 
from the initial node).

However, the paper in general, though it seems to present a useful
tool for debugging business processes, proceeds along expected lines.
The authors might want to highlight their novelties further in 
future versions of the paper.
