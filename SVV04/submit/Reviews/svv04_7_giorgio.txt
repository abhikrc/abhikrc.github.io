 3 - Main Contributions of the paper

The author presents a new algorithm for the negative cost cycle detection
problem. This problem is related to the satisfiability problem of difference
constraints, a class of constraints used, e.g., in timed automata.
The main feature of the algorithm is that it does not used extra memory
(it modifies the costs of the edges).

 4 - Points in favour or against the paper

The new algorithm is interesting and the result seems correct.
However, my objection is that no efforts have been made by the author 
to make the paper suitable for the audience of a workshop on Software 
Verification and Validation (the key word "verification" in the title 
is not enough).
I think that the paper is  more adequate for a forum on 
algorithms/operational research.
 
 5- Specific Comments for improving the paper

The paper is overly long.
