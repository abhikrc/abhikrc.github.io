Contractual consistency is checked via symbolic execution of the dynamic diagram using a theorem prover to deal with the contracts that occur in the static diagram. We develop a formal theory and definition of contractual consistency and provide a prototype tool BDT (BON Development Tool) for doing the checks automatically. To our knowledge, this is the first tool to actually check multi-view contractual consistency for a partial model involving contracts only, without the need to implement features.</i></p></font>
