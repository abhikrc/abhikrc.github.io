The Candlelight, not the Rainbow

By Abhik Roychoudhury, 6 Dec 2010


It is called a rainbow in poems and plays, opening up in vivid colors

Or often associated with the moonlight, and its glamorous halo

I think, may be it is just a simple candlelight?

Close to us, and closer to our hearts,

Within the mind's dungeon

It shines bright and creates destiny!

Every little gust, every little breeze

We fear for its end - it makes us freeze,

But onward it lasts through thick and thin

And as the candle runs out, the light is still keen!!

One day the candle does run out,

And the light too is bygone

But it shone on us all while it was there --

In our consciousness the candlelight lives on.
