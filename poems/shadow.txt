Shadow


By Abhik Roychoudhury,  11 Dec 2010




Past the light lies the shadow
Reverberating with the light

Just beyond the light
With delicate and fluid agility
The shadow moves with the light.
Lacking the colors - and the halo may be?

The shadow reflects - but its reflections are not to be seen.
It provides shade silently and truthfully to all and sundry.
Looking at the shadow at the moment of truth - 
one may stop to look, stoop, enjoy - but never to admire.

And casting a sombre mood as the light moves askance
The shadow will still move on in its enduring dance ...
