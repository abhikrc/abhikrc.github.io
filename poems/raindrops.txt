Silence of the raindrops

By Abhik Roychoudhury, composed 30 Nov 2010
 

In silence I speak with my solitude

My silence disrupted only by the incessant raindrops

Which drip through my terrace

Cutting through the night like a knife.

I stare at the dripping green in the distance

Staying awake with my thoughts and solitude.

And as the raindrops gingerly meet the ground below

My solitude waits to be touched by thoughts with equal grace.
