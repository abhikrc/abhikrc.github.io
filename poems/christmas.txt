
Modern-day Christmas Carol
By Abhik Roychoudhury, 24 Dec 2010

Christmas has come, and so have the chilly winds
Christmas is the season of giving they say -
Giving, kindness, charity ...!

But Christmas goes and comes with 
temporary bouts of kindness
Even if the chilly winds recede
the Chill in the heart never melts.

Kindness is a virtue they say -
but may be a mechanical seasonal activity
With the bells of christmas 
the strings of kindness open up mechanically.

This Christmas -
Can we open up our heart to new ideas and thoughts
And let the warmth of new ideas 
melt the chill in our hearts?


Merry Christmas!
