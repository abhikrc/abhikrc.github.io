Rigorous Methods for Software Construction: Retrofitting "Engineering" into Software Engineering

<li>
<i>Abstract of talk</i>:

<p>
In this talk I outline how rigorous, mathematically based techniques for
software construction can speed up the requirements elicitation process,
automate significant parts of software design, and establish (with
mathematical certainty) that an implementation meets its requirements.
I shall elaborate, using examples derived from practice, how these methods
can transition from academic esoterica into Industrial practice.  I shall
demonstrate an analysis tool for software-intensive systems called
Salsa, which has been successfully applied to real problems at Ford Motor
Company.  I discuss how the patented technology underlying Salsa was
transitioned to Industry within two years of the tool's initial conception.
Finally, I shall talk about the SINS project of the Naval Research Laboratory
where we apply the tools and methods related to this technology for the
specification and construction of secure and survivable agent-based middleware
for real-time distributed applications.
