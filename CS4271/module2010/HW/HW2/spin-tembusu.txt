Please follow these instructions if you want to use xspin in tembusu cluster for doing the assignment 2:
==========================================================

I have installed xspin in the tembusu cluster. For logging into this machine, you need to have an SOC unix acccount. 

If you do not have one, please create one by doing the following:
Go to https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~newacct/  and login with your 
NUSNET account. Follow the instructions further.

If you already have an account and forgot your password, go to the link https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~myacct/ with your NUSNET id  to manage 
your SOC account.

Follow these steps to use the xspin in tembusu:
====================================

1. Download and install xming in your PC. It is a free software available in 
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/. If you are doing the assignment in 
 Embedded systems teaching lab, it already has the xming installed. 

2. Launch the "xlaunch" application. Just keep all the default settings. 

3. Launch ssh secure client (installed in every machine of SOC). Go to 
"Edit menu" and go to "settings". Goto "Profile settings->Connection->Tunneling".
 Check the box "Tunnel X11 connections".
For a graphic help check 
"https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cf/x/xwin32-sshsecureshell.html" .
You need to give your SOC unix id and password to check this help. 

3. Login to sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg with your SOC unix account and password.

4. Login from sunfire to tembusu by the command 
"ssh -X tembusu.comp.nus.edu.sg" (note the "-X" option here).

5. Check for a ".bashrc" (note the ".") file in your home directory. If available, edit the file by putting the following two lines at the end 
of the file:

export PATH=$PATH:/home/s/sudiptac/TA-4271/SPIN_HOME/Spin/Src5.2.4
alias xspin=/home/s/sudiptac/TA-4271/SPIN_HOME/Spin/Src5.2.4/xspin

If the file is not in your home directory, then create one with that name (i.e. ".bashrc") by putting the above two lines in ".bashrc" file.

Save and close the file ".bashrc".

6. Type the command "source ~/.bashrc" (Note the "." again).

7. Type "xspin &" , the xspin window should appear. Try some 
test files to check whether it works.

8. In your next login to tembusu, you only need to type "source ~/.bashrc" command before launching "xspin".

If you have any problem using the application, contact me (sudiptac@comp.nus.edu.sg).
