Hi Dr Roychoudhury,


This is regarding your application to login to SoC from overseas. It has
been done. Pls use this command to login:

For telnet:
          telnet sunA.comp.nus.edu.sg 525

For ssh:
        ssh -p 524 sunA.comp.nus.edu.sg


I would also like to know, can I remove it after 23rd July?


Thanks.



Regards,
Hong Lay
