In this paper, we proposed a formal model and a tool for verification of the UML design of WA. The method is based on model checking and the properties to be verified on the model are expressed in \ctl. The implemented system parses the XMI code obtained as output of a UML design tool and builds the \smv model where properties are verified.

The proposed method and tool have the main advantage of joining the two phases of design and verification of a WA in a single automated activity. Hence, we can say \textit{WAVer} performs an ``a priori'' verification of the WA design, saving time and costs and increasing software quality; the verification is fully automated because \textit{WAVer} embeds NuSMV model checker which establish system correctness. Simulation and results prove the benefit of our approach.
