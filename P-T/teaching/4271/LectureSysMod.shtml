The lecture is centered around the simplifications that can be employed by a system designer to model real-life systems. These simplifications have been summarized in the second last slide of the lecture. </font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The lecture uses a modeling and model checking tool called <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/smv.html">Symbolic Model Verifier (SMV)</a>. SMV has been widely used for high-level modeling and debugging of hardware as well as mixed hardware-software designs. </font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the lecture, we use a concrete example of a cache coherence protocol to elaborate the modeling steps. The case study is chosen carefully:&nbsp; not too simple to be trivial, not too complex to comprehend in the span of a lecture. It helps the students to understand the system modeling principles in a classroom setting.</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><a href="lecSMV2.pdf">Download lecture notes here</a></font></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
