In other words, we try to present some case studies where formal verification techniques can detect subtle bugs which cannot be found through other validation methods.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In this lecture, we present one such case study. It is taken from a real-life System-on-Chip bus protocol in ARM processors. It is important to note that the CS 4271 course is offered as an elective to Computer Engineering students focusing on embedded systems. They are familiar with ARM processors from their past courses --- so when we present such a case study the use of formal verification techniques can appeal to the students.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the initial offering of the course, I could not provide such an appealing case study. Subsequently, as part of my own research, I came across this case study, and found some subtle bugs in the protocol design. The results from this research (which were also published, see here )&nbsp; were integrated into subsequent offerings of the course.</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><a href="SMVRev1.pdf">Download lecture notes here</a></font></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
