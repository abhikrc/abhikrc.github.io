In the midterm, we have questions (see   question C, page 4 of the attached midterm exam) which test the students   understanding of the concurrency/communication models studied in class. In the   final examination, we go one step further. We test whether the students’   understanding of the concurrency models is in-depth enough to construct new   models of concurrency/communication (e.g. see question D.1 in page 11 of the   sample final exam question paper in this module folder).</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-family: Arial"><a href="mid.pdf">Download question paper (with sample answers)</a></span></p>
