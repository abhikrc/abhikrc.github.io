The project was done on an   individual basis (i.e. by one student).</font></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>  <li><font face="Arial">The student made use of the PVS theorem proving tool   which was discussed during the course. However, he did acquire more detailed   knowledge on these techniques (beyond the lectures)&nbsp; since they are   relevant to his research as well. In other words, he used the course project   to further his research goals. </font></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>  <li><font face="Arial">Apart from the attached report (and a class   presentation), each student was required to submit his/her programs (in this   case the programming was done on top of a theorem prover) which went through   review.</font></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>  <li><font face="Arial">The report submitted by the student contained many   detailed appendices which are not relevant for the purposes of these module   folder, and they have been removed.</font></li></ul></font><p><font face="Arial"><a href="FinalReport.pdf">Download the project report</a></font></p>
