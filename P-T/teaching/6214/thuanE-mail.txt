Dear Dr Abhik,

Today is exactly one year from the time I got the workstation and started 
working in the lab. It's been a wonderful year for me. I just want to take 
this opportunity to say thank. You have taught me many important things 
which will be very useful in my life. I even learned to joke a little near 
the end! I appreciate the freedom that you usually gave me to think, I 
believe these week-long comfortable time to work really helped in producing 
those good results. In the mean time, I love way the meeting times are 
strictly scheduled and planned.
It is just impossible to list all the things, I can only say Thank you very 
much, Dr Abhik :)

Thuan
