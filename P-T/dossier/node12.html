Non-traditional Curriculum Development Activities</A>

The reputation of a department or university rests not only on its
research output, but also what the future employers say about the
students we produce. With this in mind, since 2002 <B>I have
been actively involved in formulating a new written PhD Qualifier
Examination in Computer Science at NUS School of Computing</B>. This
involved (a) deciding on set of core topics for examination (b)
deciding on type and level of difficulty of questions and (c)
setting sample question papers. In addition, since a formal
Qualifying Exam is new to NUS School of Computing, I also set up
guidelines for assessment in the examination. The entire process
of setting up the written Qualifier Examination was an intense
activity involving consultation/discussion with many colleagues
regarding (a) why a written Qualifier Exam is needed, (b) what is
the desired format/level of difficulty of the exam and (c)
assessment policies and administration of the exam. Our written
Qualifier Exam consists of two papers -- one in Theory and the
other in Computer Systems.
Since the inception of the written Qualifier Exam in 2005, I have
 <B>served as the coordinator of the Theory paper in the
Qualifier Examination</B>. The exam is offered twice a year. In each
offering of the exam, my duties involve meeting students to
clarify their queries about the exam, finding examiners to set
questions and moderate the level of difficulty of the questions. I
maintain a web-page for the Computer Science Theory Ph.D.
qualifier which provides more details about the exam --
