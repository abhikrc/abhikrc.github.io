Among the above, I completely designed the CS4271 and CS5219/6214
courses. The module folders for these two courses are included in
my <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/P-T/teaching/"><b>T</b></a><b><a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/P-T/teaching/">eaching 
Portfolio</a></b>. Following are some further
details about these two courses.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><EM>CS 4271  Critical  Systems and their Verification</EM>
<BR>
It is a relatively new course offered by School of  Computing. It
is only one of the few electives currently offered for the
Computer  Engineering students. I was solely responsible for
designing the entire course (curriculum, assessment scheme,
lecture material etc).  Since this course is associated with the
Computer Engineering program, I made this course a hands-on
course.  During the lecture/consultation hours, I show the
students some hand-on tricks in   modeling and verification
through some online exercises (e.g. during the lecture itself we
work out the modeling and verification of a substantial real-life
protocol). Also, about one-third of the grade is based on performance of the
students in a practical  term project. The term project is done in
groups of 2-3 people (bigger groups are required to take on bigger
projects). A typical project involves formally specifying and
verifying a substantial part of  a real- life embedded system
(e.g. a protocol or a hardware unit).  To train the students
appropriately for the project, I use the  following schedule.

<UL>
<LI>1st  month:   I present a comprehensive list of  potential
projects to the students.  Projects are fixed for each student.
</LI>
<LI>2nd  month:   Students finish the formal specification work
and present an interim project report.
</LI>
<LI>3rd  month:  Most of
the experimental work on formal verification is done; final
submission.

<LI><EM>CS 5219/6214: Automated Software Validation</EM>
<BR>
This is another new course offered by School of Computing for
graduate students. The purpose is expose students to sophisticated
software debugging and program understanding techniques which go
beyond traditional simulation and testing. I have designed the
course to cover a wide variety of validation techniques which
include various static checking techniques (theorem proving, model
checking and static analysis). The techniques are discussed and
explained in a concrete setting with lots of emphasis on a term
project. Since this is a graduate course, the students here are
required to perform the projects individually.
