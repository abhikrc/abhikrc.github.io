<B>Scenario-based System Requirements modeling</B></A>
</H4>
In this area, I have concentrated on developing behavioral requirement
specifications of reactive embedded systems. Our modeling notations
are compatible with the well-known Unified Modeling Language or
UML. Specifically, I have studied modeling and simulation of
distributed embedded systems with many similar interacting components
-- common in application domains like automotive control, avionics,
telecommunication and transportation [<A
 HREF="node50.html#GMRT:06">1</A>]. We have developed
symbolic methods which can simulate and analyze such systems
containing large number of <EM>similar</EM> interacting components with
minimal loss of precision.  The key contribution is to develop (a)
formal models which emphasize inter-component communication
(scenario-based system descriptions) and (b) symbolic execution
semantics to efficiently execute those models. Thus, we exploit the
behavioral similarity of components within a system to support
efficient execution of our system models (for purposes of test
generation and behavioral simulation).
Our symbolic simulator has been used to debug
realistic designs of controllers from avionics and automotive domains.
In particular, we have used it to model/analyze communication
protocols in automotive control systems such as the Media Oriented
Systems Transport (MOST) protocol used by communicating media devices
in a car network.

<i>The system requirements are useful in the early stages of embedded
system design. In reality, it is not feasible to perform all of
the analysis/validation at the requirements/model level simply
because the requirements of a system evolve over time.
Consequently, it is also important to study <u>analysis/validation
methods for software debugging</u>, a topic that I have followed up
in my research. </i>
