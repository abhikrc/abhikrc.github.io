Future Plans in Research</A>
</H1>

<P>
My current as well as future work concerns models and analysis for
embedded systems/software development. In safety-critical
application domains such as avionics, automotive, health-care
monitoring, and command-control systems -- developing reliable
bug-free embedded software is of utmost concern. Consequently,
there is increased focus on model-driven software development as
well as software certification for embedded systems. In my current
research, I have covered various modeling and analysis techniques
which can aid the development of dependable embedded systems for
safety critical application domains. This includes various
combinations of -- symbolic execution, model checking, static program
analysis, and dynamic analysis. More importantly, I have looked at
the various stages of embedded system design -- requirements,
design models and hardware/software implementations.

<P>
In future, I plan to build on my current work by bringing tighter
connections between the different stages of model-based design flow
for embedded systems. Currently, model based design flows proceed from
(informal) requirements to (semi-formal) design models; subsequently,
the design models are converted to implementations in a
(semi)-automated fashion. There is now an enhanced understanding on
the importance of propagating both functional and extra-functional
constraints (such as timing constraints) from requirements level to
the implementation level.  Central to this work is the concept of
model transformations -- where requirement models get translated to
design models which further get translated to implementation
models. Indeed, this issue is being taken seriously even in industrial
tools. In the following, I discuss some long term research plans in this
direction.


<P>
In the longer term, I am studying the possibility of
developing <EM>bi-directional links</EM> between requirements, design
models and implementations in the context of embedded system
design. Currently, system design focuses on generating design
models from requirements, and system implementation from design
models. However, as most practitioners will agree, it is often
impossible to get a complete set of system requirements at one go.
Consequently, it is difficult to generate correct-by-construction
designs and implementation at one go. This makes it difficult (or
even impossible) to perform all of the validation at the model
level and none at the software level.
Now, when we perform testing/debugging of the software
implementations, if functional errors are found -- it very hard
to relate back the error to the model/requirement level. In the
longer term, I am thinking of studying the issue of <EM>backward
association between system implementations and design models.</EM>
Currently, there exist number of commercial tools for
(semi)-automatically generating software implementations from
system models specified in the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
However, the association between models and code is (mostly) a
forward one. There is hardly any mechanism for mapping back the
code elements to corresponding model elements. Even for state
diagrams (which form the key executable part of UML) many of the
model elements cannot be retrieved once C/C++/Java code has been
generated. Such backwards communication between software and
models can be crucial for communicating changes/fixes in the
software to the embedded system designer or even other
stakeholders. This is particularly important from a pragmatic
point of view since in reality embedded system design (currently)
involves lot of low-level optimizations at the implementation
level.

<P>
So, to effectively support model-driven development of embedded
systems for safety-critical applications, we need to seriously
build backward links between system implementations and system
models. We need to study whether <!-- MATH
 $software \rightarrow model$
 -->
software to model
backward associations can be seamlessly integrated into UML design
tools, particularly those which proceed by (forward)
transformation of design models to implementations. Clearly, we
also need to study the nature of models suitable for such backward
associations - whether we take UML state diagrams or richer
models [<A
 HREF="node50.html#GMRT:06">1</A>] with UML-compatible notations. The ability to 
relate code elements with model elements must also be seamlessly integrated with 
various code-level debugging methods -- model checking, slicing, fault 
localization or even performance debugging (using execution-time analysis). 
Finally, as a more ambitious goal, we can try to relate design models to 
(informal) requirements -- thereby completing the backward link between 
software, design models and requirements.<P>
