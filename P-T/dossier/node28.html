In this area, I have studied static program analysis techniques
for providing upper bounds on the execution time of a given
program on a given platform. A key practical difficulty in
developing such analysis methods is the abundance of
performance-enhancing micro-architectural features in today's
processors. Consequently, the analysis for estimating the maximum
execution time of software cannot be blind to the hardware; the
timing effects of the underlying processor need to be taken into
account. We have developed static analysis methods for estimating a
program's execution time in presence of processor
micro-architectural features like out-of-order pipelines, cache
and branch prediction [<A
 HREF="node50.html#LRM:06">4</A>]. The main difficulty arises
from the large number of possible system states when the
micro-architectural features are taken into account. We propose a
novel event-based fixed-point analysis method which avoids such
state space explosion and still provides accurate execution time
estimates.<P>
