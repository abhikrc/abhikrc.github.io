Teaching Philosophy</A>

<P>
Effective teaching has often been associated with effective
dissemination of knowledge leading to advanced understanding of a
topic by the students. One can also extend this definition
 to include the notion of ``conceptualization'' - where
the students not only understand a specific topic of a discipline,
but also can extrapolate this understanding in other topics or in
real-life problems. As an educator, I feel that effective teaching
goes far beyond effective understanding and conceptualization of
the students as learners. It involves <B>integration of the
spirit of research into teaching and vice-versa</B>.
What we mean by integration of research into teaching is
a situation where the course instructor becomes a <EM>serious
learner</EM> himself/herself and the teaching facilitates this
process. So, by teaching a course, the instructor is spurred to
conduct research on certain cutting edge topics which are
later integrated into course(s).

<P>
As an example, let me refer to a graduate level module I have
offered thrice. The title of this module is ``Automated Software
Validation''. While teaching some traditional formal techniques
for software validation, <EM>some of the difficulties in using
them for software debugging became clearer to me</EM>.  I came to
fully realize that the user does not often have a clear
specification of the ``error'' being checked - rather he/she only
has an understanding that the behavior of a program for a
particular input is unexpected. This inspired me to do research in
semi-formal techniques on software fault localization with one of
my Ph.D. students. Some of the understanding/experience gained
from this effort has been integrated into a lecture in the third
offering of the course.

<P>
The combined spirit of research by the teacher and students is, by no
means, restricted to graduate courses. In the following, I outline
some teaching methods which I employed in my <EM>undergraduate
teaching</EM> for this purpose.  It is worthwhile to mention here that in
the last three years I have taught courses on formal verification or
logic -- topics which are relatively mathematical in nature. Of
course an important task in the teaching of such courses is to relate
these mathematical topics to the actual practice of computer system
design. However, this relationship is often brought out in an extreme
way (in textbooks or other teaching materials) -- dramatic historical
incidents which led to the spectacular failure of computer systems due
to the lack of formal verification are presented to the students. This
clearly attracts the students' attention, but this interest becomes
difficult to retain, possibly because the historical incidents seem
far removed. Instead, to motivate more mathematical topics like formal
verification, I felt that the students need to <EM>understand</EM>
the impact of formal verification in system design; they do <EM>not</EM>
need to be surprised. So, in my <EM>undergraduate course</EM> on formal
verification of embedded systems, I start with existing practices
of verification/validation and how they are intrusive to the
design process. I then discuss how a model-based formal approach
can help the design cycle, without referring to historic disasters
that occurred due to lack of formal verification. This results in
a rather different pedagogical style, where the aim is to discuss
the system design cycle with the students rather than surprising
the students with the power of formal verification and logic. Once
the learners appreciate the differences in the techniques, they
develop a more long-lasting interest. This results in a learning
process with more active participation from teacher/students -- a
goal which I always try to achieve in my classes. Furthermore,
such classroom discussions have, from time to time, spurred my own
research, the results of which have later been integrated into
teaching.

<P>
As a concrete example, let me again refer to 
<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/CS4271">CS 4271</a>, the undergraduate
elective offered in the Computer Engineering programme at NUS
School of Computing, which I have taught. The title of this module
is ``Critical Systems and their Verification'', and it is meant to
focus on formal techniques for design of embedded computing
systems.  When I started teaching this module, I found a lack of
classroom examples through which I could elaborate some practical
experiences in validating (substantial) parts of an embedded
system. Around the same time, in the context of some research work
in modeling reactive embedded systems I have been studying ARM's
AMBA system-on-chip bus protocol. Working with a senior
undergraduate student (whose final year project I was
supervising), I figured that the AMBA protocol had some subtle
corner cases leading to a deadlock which are hard to find using
informal manual reasoning. This work was published in DATE 2003, a
leading conference in embedded system/design automation. More
importantly, it provided with a good hands-on case study which I
could provide to my students in the CS 4271 course. It serves to
illustrate exactly what role automated formal reasoning techniques
can hope to play in practice for debugging subtle design errors. I
have therefore, included this as a case study in later offerings
of the CS4271 course.

<P>
In summary, my teaching methods are driven by an effort to
cross-fertilize teaching and research. I have adopted these
methods in classroom teaching as well as in other forms of
teaching such as student supervision. As educators, I feel that
<B>we should strive to break the walls between ``teaching" and
``research" in our own minds</B>.  This can enhance a new spirit of
excellence, allowing us to try and seek the best for our learners.
