I have started a new workshop focussing on software validation,
the International Workshop on Software Verification and
Validation. It has been held for four consecutive years. In 2006,
it was co-located with the Federated Logic Conferences (FLoC) at
Seattle. I have also served as a program committee member of a
number of conferences, and a reviewer for many
journals/conferences. Details of these services are listed in the
<EM>Documents on Research</EM> chapter (<a href="node43.html#sec:review">see 
here</a> ) and&nbsp; hence these are not repeated here.
