Nature of citations</A>
</H4> Apart from the raw citation numbers, the context/fashion in which a paper is cited is also indicative of how the research result is received or used by other researchers. In this context, I present some recent citations of one of my works done at NUS. In particular, my 
<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/pdf/icse02.pdf">work on program verification by considering the Java memory model</a> has been useful in the context of understanding program behaviors in the presence of complex memory consistency models.
Here are some citations giving detailed description of the work.

<UL>
<LI>``Roychoudhury and Mitra [25] suggested a formal specification for
the Java memory model (JMM) using guarded commands, and apply
their specification when analyzing multithreaded Java programs….
Their work is focused on the JMM but it can be tuned to other weak
memory consistency models. Our approach can be extended to support
their formal specification."

<LI>``The Java Memory Model [Gosling et al. 1996; Roychoudhury and
Mitra 2002] is equivalent  to entry consistency because locks are

tackle this problem [30] i.e. …… They opt for the third approach
because …. However, we can still settle on the first approach,
