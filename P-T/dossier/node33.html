<B>Tools developed</B></A>

As part of my research, me and my students have released several
software analysis tools for use in research, teaching and
development. <EM>One of them is already being used for lab
assignments in a fourth-year undergraduate course.</EM> In particular,
the following are mature program analysis tools for software
written in general-purpose programming languages like C or Java.

<UL>
<LI><b><EM>Jslice</EM>:</b> Jslice is a dynamic slicing tool for Java
programs. Given a program and an input, it can explain the cause
of ``unexpected behaviors" in the program's execution by
highlighting portions of the program responsible for those
behaviors. Jslice is available as open-source software from <TT>
<a href="http://jslice.sourceforge.net">http://jslice.sourceforge.net/</a></TT> It has been distributed with the
widely-used Kaffe Virtual Machine at the request of Kaffe developers.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><b><EM>Chronos</EM>:</b> Chronos is a tool for estimating the maximum
execution time of any C program on a given processor platform. It
proceeds by static analysis of the program source code while
taking the underlying processor hardware into consideration.
Chronos is available as open-source software from
<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~rpembed/chronos"><TT>

</LI>
</UL>
Both of the above tools have been released recently (2005-06), so
we do not have detailed statistics of their usage. However, we
have been approached by researchers and developers for the usage
of these tools. In particular, for the JSlice tool, we were
approached by developers of the Kaffe Virtual machine for
integrating/distributing our work with Kaffe. Jslice is now integrated with the widely-used <EM>Kaffe
Virtual Machine</EM> for Java.
