Research Grants</A>
</H2>

<P>
Apart from several grants from within the faculty (School of
Computing) and the university (NUS URC projects), I have attracted
substantial funding from outside the university. My research has
been supported quite steadily by government agencies as well as
industry. <EM>A full list of research grants appears in my
detailed CV.</EM> In the following, I highlight the following three
research grants supported by industry, government and special
initiatives; I have served as the Principal Investigator of these
three grants.

<UL>
<LI>My research on software validation and debugging methods has been
supported by the following <B>Public Sector research grant from
Agency of Science Technology and Research (A*STAR)</B>. Apart from
publications in prestigious venues, the output from this research
project includes some large-scale software productivity tools
which can be useful in research and developement.

<LI>As far as <B>industry funding</B> is concerned, I recently received a
small research grant from Microsoft. The work done in the project
led to increased understanding of "corner-case" behaviors of C#
programs and the development of a prototype verifier at the
bytecode level [<A
 HREF="node50.html#TR:06">3</A>]. Following are the details of the
grant.

<BR>2005-2006, Budget: S$ 24,000
</TT></PRE>

</LI>
<LI>I have served as the Principal Investigator (PI) of a
<B>multi-disciplinary research grant</B> supported by the NUS
Infocomm and Infotech Initiative (ICITI). The project was a
collaboration with NUS Science Faculty. <TT><br>
<br>

<EM>Efficient Design Space Exploration of Embedded Systems</EM><br>
<BR>		 <B>PI: Abhik Roychoudhury</B><br>
<BR>Co-PI: Biman Chakraborty (NUS Dept of Statistics), Tulika Mitra (NUS Dept of Computer Science)<br>
<BR>2003 -2006, Budget: S$ 75,000<br>
</TT>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In addition to the above projects where I served as the Principal
Investigator (PI), I have also been a Co-PI of <B>major projects
from the Agency of Science Technology and Research (A*STAR)</B>. This
includes the following two projects funded under A*STAR's Embedded
and Hybrid Systems Programme.

<UL>
<LI><font face="Courier New" size="2"><EM>EASEL: Engineering Architectures and Software for the Embedded
