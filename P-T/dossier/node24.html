Overall Goals</A>

<P>
Reliable software/system development is a key challenge in
computing and information sciences. Indeed a 2003 conference
series on Grand Challenges in Computer Science and Engineering
organized by the Computing Research Association (CRA) lists
dependable system development as one of the five key challenges
for the future. However, the problem in this area is one of scale
and applicability -- the techniques for developing reliable
software often do not scale up to real-life systems. In the last
six years, I have conducted research on building dependable
embedded systems via formal modeling, analysis and debugging. The
overarching goal is to develop techniques which are scalable and
give increased confidence about system behavior at different
levels of abstraction -- models, software and assembly code.

<P>
Specifically, in the last six years, I have concentrated on the
following three directions.

<UL>
<LI>Requirements for Embedded System Modeling and Design
</LI>
<LI>Validation and debugging of software functionality
</LI>
<LI>Platform-aware timing analysis of embedded software
</LI>
</UL>
The work on requirements modeling focuses on behavioral system
requirements at the early stages of (embedded) system design. The
work on software debugging proceeds by analyzing a program or a
program trace at the level of generic programming languages like C
or Java. The focus is on functionality validation. The work on
software timing analysis proceeds at a lower level since the
underlying hardware behavior is also taken into account while
analyzing the execution time of (embedded) software.

<P>
The three directions cut across the various layers of abstraction
involved in system design. This has also helped me understand
better the problems that arise in software/systems validation. In
the following, I outline the significant research accomplishments.
