Five Selected Publications</A>
</H2>

<P>
Following are five major publications resulting from my research
work in the past six years. These publications demonstrate how I
have contributed in the related fields of formal system modeling
(ICSE 2006), software analysis (ICSE 2004, RTSS 2004), and
software verification (FM 2006, CAV 2001).

<LI><EM><a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/pdf/icse06.pdf">Interacting Process Classes</a>, ICSE 2006</EM>.
<BR>
This work develops a novel modeling and simulation framework for
distributed embedded systems with many similar interacting
processes. The main contribution is to support time and memory
efficient simulation of designs while allowing combination of rich
modeling constructs compatible with the Unified Modeling Language
(UML). The applications of this work lie in the design of
distributed embedded systems with behaviorally similar processes
such as a traffic controller controlling many cars/trains/aircrafts.

<LI><EM><a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/pdf/icse04.pdf">Using Compressed Bytecode Traces for Slicing Java
programs</a>, ICSE 2004</EM>
<BR>
This work develops methods for debugging Java programs based on
analysis of program execution runs. The research has led to the
<EM>Jslice</EM> dynamic slicing tool for Java programs -- the first
of its kind. This is useful, since dynamic slicing is a popular
technique which forms the core of many program
development/analysis methods. However, slicing tools for real-life
programming languages (like Java) are relatively hard to come by.
Our research in this paper aims to fill this gap.

Analysis</a>, Real-Time Systems Journal, 2006</EM>
<BR>
This work develops
static analysis methods for tightly estimating the maximum
execution time of a program when the program is executing on a
processor with advanced micro-architectural features. The work had
led to the <EM>Chronos</EM> Worst-case Execution time estimation tool
for C programs, which can be used for scheduling and performance
estimation of real-time/embedded software. The typical
applications are in safety-critical embedded software from
application domains like automotive and avionics. A detailed
version of the paper has appeared in the <EM>Real-time
System Journal</EM> in 2006.

<LI><em><a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/pdf/fm06.pdf">A Memory Model 
Sensitive Checker for C#</a>, FM</em> 2006<BR>
Reasoning about concurrent program behaviors is hard. In this
work, we study how to accurately capture all possible behaviors of
a  program written in a modern multi-threaded programming language like C#.. We show that current verification
techniques (mistakenly) assume a strong execution model called
"Sequential Consistency", which may result in a verified correct
program exhibiting violations of the property verified! We then
discuss how the semantics of multi-threading can be accurately
described and incorporated into program verification. Even though
the results are for C#, the ideas are generic and can be applied to other 
programming languages like Java (a related work appears<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/pdf/icse02.pdf"> 
here</a>.)<p>

<LI><EM><a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/pdf/cav01.pdf">Automated inductive verification of Parameterized
Protocols</a>, CAV 2001</EM><BR>
Many distributed systems can be described as unbounded collections
of similar processes. In this work, we prove properties about such
systems by employing a mix of automated methods (search) and
mathematical induction. The main conceptual novelty comes from
automating these induction proofs by gleaning the induction schema
directly from the system description; logic program manipulation
techniques are used for this purpose. A large part of this
research was done during my Ph.D. work at SUNY Stony Brook.
