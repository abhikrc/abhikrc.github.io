Invited Papers and Presentations</A>
</H2>

<P>
For my work on UML-based system requirements modeling and
analysis, I was most recently <B>invited to write/present a
paper</B> at the <EM>International Symposium on Leveraging
Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation
(ISoLA) 2006</EM> [Track on Highly Reliable Software]. ISoLA primarily
looks at practical applications of formal verification methods; it
forms a meeting ground for researchers and users of formal methods
to get together and study adoption of formal methods into
practice. I have also given several other invited presentations of
my work on UML-based requirements modeling, which includes the
following venues.

<UL>
<LI><B>Invited full-day tutorial</B> at the Intl. Conf. on Petri Nets
and Other Models of Concurrency (ICATPN) 2005, USA (jointly with
P.S. Thiagarajan).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Workshop on Predictable Software Component Assembly,
University of Manchester, UK, September 2005.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Workshop on Formal Methods for Design and Analysis of
Software, Microsoft Research, October 2005.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Invited by IEEE chapter of IIT Kharagpur (India) for a
presentation -- January 2006.

</LI>
<LI>Presentation at United Nations University - International
Institute of Software Technology (UNU-IIST), Macau, June 2006.

<P>
For my work on timing analysis of embedded software, I have been
<B>invited to write a book chapter</B> in the Second Edition of the
widely-used <EM>Compiler Design Handbook</EM> (jointly with Tulika
Mitra). I gave an invited presentation on this topic at the
University of Florida, Gainesville in June 2005. I have also
given contributed tutorials on this topic at the Intl. Conf. on
Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM) 2005, and IEEE Intl. Conf. on
VLSI Design (VLSI) 2007.

<P>
For my PhD work on combining lightweight inductive proofs with
automated reasoning, I was <B>invited to the <EM>International
Conference on Logic Programming</EM> (ICLP) 2002 for giving a tutorial</B>
(see <TT><A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="http://floc02.diku.dk/ICLP/">http://floc02.diku.dk/ICLP/</A></TT> for details). I was one of only
four invited tutorial speakers at ICLP 2002 (one speaker for each day
of the conference). The focus of this tutorial was to discuss how
logic program evaluation/transformation can be flexibly used to
automatically reason about distributed systems. I was also <B>invited to
write a chapter</B> in the book ``<EM>Program Development in
Computational Logic</EM>" (published 2004), which summarizes the last ten
years of development in this field.
