<B>Analysis Methods for Software Debugging</B></A>
</H4>
In this area, I have studied various problems involving program
comprehension/debugging. Since debugging often proceeds by trying out
test cases of a program, it is important to study debugging methods
which proceed by analyzing the program trace(s) or execution
run(s). In particular, with my Ph.D. student Tao Wang, I have
developed methods and tools for dynamic slicing [<A
 HREF="node50.html#WR:04">7</A>].  Dynamic
slicing is a generic technique for program comprehension which
highlights parts of a program responsible for an observable ``bug". It
forms the core of many program development tasks such as understanding
the cause of software performance degradation and software
verification. To the best of our knowledge, our
<a href="http://jslice.sourceforge.net"> <EM>Jslice</EM> tool </a>is
the only tool for dynamic slicing for the Java programming language.
Recently, we have also investigated debugging methods which select and
compare execution runs of a program for software fault localization
[<A
 HREF="node50.html#GRW:06">2</A>].

<P>
I have also studied formal verification methods for software --
such as software model checking or lightweight theorem proving. In
particular, I have studied the role of programming language memory
models for software model checking [<A
 HREF="node50.html#TR:06">3</A>,<A
 HREF="node50.html#RM:02">5</A>]. Some of
these model checkers are built using (tabled) logic programming
systems.  In my Ph.D. work, I had studied formal techniques for
proving invariant properties of parameterized protocols/software
-- where the number of processes/threads is unbounded. We
developed an automated inductive proof technique which combines
model checking and lightweight induction. In this work, the
protocol/program's behavior is encoded as a logic program. This
logic program is <EM>automatically transformed</EM> so that the
recursive structure of the transformed program provides the
schema/plan for the induction proofs.

<i>In reality, validation methods for software systems should not be
restricted to checking functionality properties alone. The correctness
of many computing systems depends on the timing of its constituent
operations. This is particularly so for embedded systems where many
systems are also real-time, that is, they operate under
tight timing constraints imposed by the environment they operate in.
In my research, I have developed <u>analysis methods/tools for estimating
the execution times of programs</u>. The results from this research forms
the core of system level timing analysis and validation methods. </i>
