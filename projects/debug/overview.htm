			</font></h2>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Developing automated 
			techniques for validating/verifying software - at 
			compile-time, run-time or post-mortem- is of obvious 
			importance. Such techniques are vital for program 
			understanding and reliable program development. There is 
			renewed interest in automated software validation due to 
			recent progress in automatic extraction of transition 
			system-like models from code. This makes model checking 
			-- a search-based automated verification technique for 
			hardware circuits/microprocessors -- accessible for 
			software verification as well. Currently, there is lot 
			of work in both academia and industry in using model 
			checking for debugging realistic pieces of software such 
			as device drivers. This project will investigate a 
			related but somewhat different theme: integration of 
			search-based debugging methods into (embedded) software 
			development.&nbsp; We do not directly use model checking for 
			debugging. However, search-based simulation/checking 
			methods are used to increase the degree of automation in 
			existing debugging tasks.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">Our focus is mostly on 
			embedded/control systems and we are working both at the 
			requirements (model) level as well as the program level. 
			The specific research directions being pursued are as 
			follows.</font></p>
