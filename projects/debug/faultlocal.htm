		<p align="left"><b><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Identifying 
		the Buggy Locations in a Program</font></i></b></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Software fault localization 
		involves locating the exact cause of error for a &quot;failing&quot; execution run 
		&#8211; a run which exhibits an unexpected behavior. We have proposed 
		several methods for identifying the cause of error, which are based on 
		execution tracing and analysis. Our key contributions are:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Dynamic Slicing</b>: 
			Dynamic slicing finds out statements in the buggy program which 
			affected the unexpected behavior during the failing execution run, 
			via dynamic control or data dependencies. It is performed on an 
			execution trace to detect dynamic control and data dependencies. In 
			practice, execution traces maybe be&nbsp; too huge to fit into the 
			memory. We have proposed a method which can collect, store, and 
			analyze (for slicing) an execution trace all in compressed form. 
			Initial experiments show that our method is efficient in both time 
			and space.</font></p>

            slicing tool for Java programs.</a></font></b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Distance Metric 
			Evaluation</b>: The fault localization is done by comparing the 
			&quot;failing&quot; execution run with one that does not exhibits the 
			erroneous behavior (&quot;successful&quot; run). Furthermore, a decision shall 
			be made to choose a particular &quot;successful&quot; run among a large pool 
			of such runs. We have been studying a metric based on the &quot;distance&quot; 
			between a &quot;failing&quot; run and a &quot;successful&quot; run, which can be used to 
			both select a &quot;nearest&quot; successful run to a failing run and locate 
			the buggy statement.</font></p></li>
			<li>
			<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Automated Path 
			Generation</b>: When fault localization is proceeded by comparing 
			the &quot;failing&quot; run with some &quot;successful&quot; run, an issue here is to 
			generate or choose a suitable successful run; this task is often 
			left to the programmer. We have proposed an efficient technique 
			where the construction of the successful run as well its comparison 
			with the failing run is automated. Our method constructs a 
			successful program run by toggling the outcomes of some conditional 
			branch instances in the failing run. If such a successful run 
			exists, program statements for these branches are returned as bug 
			report.</font></p></li>
