<p><font face="Arial" size="2">My family migrated from East Bengal to West 
Bengal 
 in 1915, around hundred years ago. My grandfather moved to
<a href="http://www.calcuttaweb.com">Calcutta</a> where he completed his 
education. He was a professor&nbsp;of Anthropology in the University of 
Calcutta from where he retired after training an entire generation of academics. He was awarded 
the President of India 
Gold Medal for lifelong  contributions in his field (Anthropology).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">My parents have spent their lives in Calcutta, an 
electrical engineer and a schoolteacher by profession. In summary, my family has 
been in the City of Joy (as Calcutta is fondly referred to) ever since 1910, 
until I moved out for my doctoral studies to <a href="http://www.iloveny.com">NY</a>. 
After my doctoral studies, I moved to <a href="http://www.visitsingapore.com">Singapore
</a>along with my spouse <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tulika">Tulika</a>. 
Our son Jishnu was born in Singapore (2003).

2011. Jishnu was 8 years old at that time.</font></p>
